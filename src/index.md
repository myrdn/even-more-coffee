I am Myrdin, I work with [Mathilde](https://mathild.eu) at [clic2000](https://clic2000.fr) in a co-op [(Chrysalide)](https://www.cae29.coop/).

I love coffee, hiking and static websites.

I am learning web development by myself and at my own pace. Recently I have become interested in web accessibility.

Here I'll try to share things about my work, what I learn; in english or french.
