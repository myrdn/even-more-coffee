Here is a post about which tools I use (mostly) for work and how do I use it.

# OS
I use to be a GNU/Linux, BSD distro hopper but I realize that I was spending more time on tweaking and hacking my OS than working on my projects. I am now using MacOS and I am happy with it. By leaving the endless distro hopping I was into I can now focus on my work.
I install and remove programs with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

# Terminal
I use MacOS default terminal with zsh. I use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to configure my theme and add plugins. My theme is [minimal](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/minimal.zsh-theme) and my plugins are `git` and `macos`. 

# Text editor
I type almost everything in [Vim](ttps://www.vim.org). I love it, I am starting to feel comfortable with it and that's pure power and joy. I only added [emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim) and [Lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) as plugins. My `.vimrc` is 89 lines and I add stuff to it when I discover useful tips. I use Vim for journaling and I recently did some scripting and learned about templates to automate this process. Netrw, Vim's builtin file explorer, is my friend and I don't need [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree). Also, as I want to keep things minimal and because I don't use a lot of plugins, I install it manually without plugins manager. 

# Browser
My browser is firefox with these plugins :
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) (must have to survive on internet)
- [I don't care about cookies](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/) (because I don't care about cookies)
- [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) (help me correcting some accessibility issues)
- [Pixel Perfect pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect-pro/) (good tool for integration)
- [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) (I like to know with wich technologies sites are built)

# Time management, working workflow
I try to avoid distractions while working and I also use [the Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

I add tasks to my [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) todo list. It is configured with [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) to track time I spend on my projects. In addition I use the [Taskwarrior Pomodoro](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/taskwarrior-pomodoro), it is the only program allowed to send me notifications while working or studying (when the pomodoro is ending and that I have to take a break). I am really happy with this Monterey setting that allows you to finely configure which program can send you notifications. With this technique I can focus on my tasks, I only check and answer my emails and text messages during the breaks. Working with this technique is promoted for productivity but in my view it is also a good reminder to take rest and you know that rest is important.

# Miscellaneous
- [Squoosh Cli](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/cli) (for images compression)
- [Accessible colors](https://accessible-colors.com/) (to find the closest accessible colors)
- [Browser Sync](https://browsersync.io/) (don't need to reload page anymore)
