Here is a post about which tools I use for (mostly) for work and how do I use it.

# OS

I use to be a GNU/Linux, BSD distro hopper but I realize that I was spending more time on tweaking and hacking my OS than working on my projects. I am now using MacOS and I am happy with it. By leaving the endless distro hopping I was into I can now focus on my work and that's what I wanted switching to MacOS.

# Terminal

I use MacOS default terminal with zsh. I use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to configure my theme and add plugins. My theme is [minimal](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/minimal.zsh-theme) and my plugins are `git` and `macos`. 

# Text editor

I type almost everything in [Vim](ttps://www.vim.org). I love it, I am starting to feel comfortable with it and that's pure power and joy. I only added [emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim) and [Lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) as plugins. My `.vimrc` is 89 lines and I add stuff to it when I discover useful tips. I use Vim for journaling and I recently did some scripting and learned about templates to automate this process. Netrw, Vim's builtin file explorer is my friend and I don't need [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree). Also as I want to keep things minimal and because I don't use a lot of plugins I install it manually without plugins manager.
